## 🚀 Release Notes: v1.0.0 → v1.0.1
**📅 January 11, 2026**

With today's update, **Univo** has become much more stable, faster, and user-friendly. Here's what's new in **v1.0.1**:

### ✨ Highlights
- **🎨 Crystal Clear UI (Header Sync):**
    - The millisecond delay between the PC header and the page body has been **completely eliminated**.
    - No more "white flash" or layout shifts on load; thanks to `HeaderSkeleton` and `!transition-none` optimizations, experience a buttery smooth load.
- **📝 Seamless Post Editing:**
    - You can now safely edit your posts and **#hashtags**.
    - Server-side verification added: What you see on your screen is exactly what is committed to the database.
- **⚡ Smart Agenda:**
    - When you update a post, the "Campus Agenda" (Sidebar) cards update instantly without needing a page refresh.
- **🧹 Project Cleanup:**
    - Dozens of temporary files and logs in the root directory have been cleaned. SQL files moved to `database/`, legacy assets to `archive/`.

### 🛠️ Technical Changelog
> **v1.0.1**
> * `fix(ui)`: Removed PC Header transition animations to ensure synchronization.
> * `feat(skeleton)`: Added `HeaderSkeleton`, `VoiceViewSkeleton`, `CommunityViewSkeleton` components.
> * `fix(api)`: Removed `.single()` from `PUT /api/voices/[id]` endpoint to resolve "Cannot coerce..." error.
> * `fix(frontend)`: Implemented optimistic updates with server confirmation for `VoiceView` editing.
> * `chore`: Cleaned project file structure, organized `.sql` and log files.
