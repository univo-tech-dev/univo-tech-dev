## 🚀 Release Notes: v1.1.0 → v1.2.0
**📅 January 18, 2026**

This update is a massive leap forward for **media consumption**, introducing a studio-grade video engine that solves compatibility issues and delivers a premium, immersive feed experience.

### ✨ Highlights
- **🎥 Universal Video Engine (FFmpeg Wasm):**
    - Say goodbye to "Format Not Supported". We now perform **client-side transcoding** for iPhone (HEVC) and high-bitrate videos.
    - All uploads are automatically converted to universally compatible MP4/H.264 format before they even hit the server.
- **📱 Smart Autoplay Feed:**
    - The feed now feels alive. Videos **automatically play** when they scroll to the center of your screen.
    - **Single-Stream Focus:** Only one video plays at a time. The moment you scroll away, it pauses, saving data and battery.
    - **Polite Playback:** Videos start muted by default to respect your environment.
- **🎨 Adaptive Player UI:**
    - The video player is no longer "soulless". Controls (volume, progress bar) now dynamically adopt your **University's Theme Color** (Red for METU, etc.).
    - Fixed aspect ratios ensure no more "cropped cat heads"—vertical videos are displayed perfectly with smart containment.

### 🛠️ Technical Changelog
> **v1.2.0**
> * `feat(video)`: Integrated `ffmpeg.wasm` (20MB+ lazy-loaded) for robust client-side transcoding.
> * `feat(ux)`: Implemented `IntersectionObserver` logic with `useRef` constraints for reliable auto-play/pause.
> * `style(player)`: Refactored `VideoPlayer` to use CSS variables (`--primary-color`) for themed controls.
> * `fix(build)`: Resolved TypeScript casting errors for `FileData` in FFmpeg implementation.
> * `fix(mobile)`: Enforced strictly typed `muted` attributes to satisfy iOS/Chrome autoplay policies.

## 🚀 Release Notes: v1.0.2 → v1.1.0
**📅 January 16, 2026**

This major update introduces the **Moderation Suite**, allowing the community to stay safe via reporting and banning systems, alongside significant admin tool refinements.

### ✨ Highlights
- **🚩 Content Reporting System:**
    - Users can now report inappropriate posts or comments.
    - Added a dedicated **"Reports"** dashboard for admins to review and resolve flags.
- **🚫 User Ban Infrastructure:**
    - Comprehensive banning system with categories (Spam, Harassment, etc.).
    - Custom ban reasons and a dedicated **Ban Screen** for restricted users.
- **🛠️ Admin Panel Evolution:**
    - **Dynamic Sidebar:** Navigation links now correctly reflect the active page with focus highlighting.
    - **Centric Design:** Sidebar headers now use elegant serif typography with perfect centering.
    - **Theme Harmony:** The "Admin Panel" icon in settings is now fully theme-aware (dark/light).
- **⚡ UX & Performance:**
    - **Zero Flash Skeletons:** Eliminated the skeleton loader "flicker" on login and admin pages.
    - **Auth Sync:** Aligned administrative cookie flows to ensure seamless login transitions.

### 🛠️ Technical Changelog
> **v1.1.0**
> * `feat(mod)`: Implemented `ReportContext`, `ReportModal`, and administrative report resolution flow.
> * `feat(auth)`: Added `univo_admin_session` cookie promotion and session synchronization.
> * `feat(admin)`: Created `AdminSidebar` client component for dynamic path tracking.
> * `fix(ui)`: Moved `pathname` checks to top-level `Header` to prevent intrusive Suspense fallbacks.
> * `refactor`: Unified sidebar header layouts across `AdminLayout` and `DashboardLayout`.

## 🚀 Release Notes: v1.0.1 → v1.0.2
**📅 January 11, 2026**

This update focuses on deep stability, social features, and pixel-perfect UI refinements.

### ✨ Highlights
- **🔍 Manual Encoding Audit (100% Clean):**
    - A line-by-line manual audit was performed across all critical files (`VoiceView.tsx`, `CommentSystem.tsx`, `VoiceStatsWidget.tsx`).
    - All lingering artifacts (encoding errors) have been purged.
- **👥 Social & Profile Integration:**
    - 3-dot menus in posts and comments now feature **"Add Friend"** and **"View Profile"** buttons for non-owners.
    - Standardized Social UI: The profile visit button now matches the aesthetic of our friendship action buttons.
- **🛡️ Ownership Hardening:**
    - "Edit" and "Delete" options are now strictly conditional, appearing only for content owners to prevent UI clutter and accidental interaction triggers.
- **🎨 Threading & Layout Fixes:**
    - **Dynamic Connectors**: Fixed the vertical line over-extension bug in comment threads. The rail now scales perfectly with content.
    - **Hashtag Resilience**: Regex patterns updated with Unicode escapes (`\uXXXX`) for permanent encoding stability.

### 🛠️ Technical Changelog
> **v1.0.2**
> * `feat(social)`: Integrated `FriendButton` and Profile links into common 3-dot menus.
> * `fix(ui)`: Resolved vertical line bleeding in `VoiceView` avatar column by removing hardcoded `h-56` constraints.
> * `fix(encoding)`: Conducted full manual audit; replaced all corrupted characters with clear UTF-8 equivalents.
> * `refactor`: Unified button styles and casing across `CommentItem` and `VoiceItem`.

### ✨ Highlights
- **🎨 Crystal Clear UI (Header Sync):**

    - You can now safely edit your posts and **#hashtags**.
    - Server-side verification added: What you see on your screen is exactly what is committed to the database.
- **⚡ Smart Agenda:**
    - When you update a post, the "Campus Agenda" (Sidebar) cards update instantly without needing a page refresh.
- **🧹 Project Cleanup:**
    - Dozens of temporary files and logs in the root directory have been cleaned. SQL files moved to `database/`, legacy assets to `archive/`.

### 🛠️ Technical Changelog
> **v1.0.1**
> * `fix(ui)`: Removed PC Header transition animations to ensure synchronization.
> * `feat(skeleton)`: Added `HeaderSkeleton`, `VoiceViewSkeleton`, `CommunityViewSkeleton` components.
> * `fix(api)`: Removed `.single()` from `PUT /api/voices/[id]` endpoint to resolve "Cannot coerce..." error.
